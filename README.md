# This Project will be refactored using React.js soon
Imagine the following scenario: you are sitting on your sofa, watching a good movie on YouTube playing from your computer. Suddenly, your friend calls on your mobile phone. You are in a bad mood because you have to walk to your computer, trying to pause the movie, answering your friend's call!

Now, imagine a similar scenario: sitting on your sofa, watching a good movie on YouTube playing from your computer. Still, your friend calls on your mobile phone at the wrong time! No hard feeling this time. You take out your phone, switch to the YouTube Remote Controller, clicking the pause button with no sweat, using the same phone to talk to your friend!

Splendid! Let us implement a YouTube Player on the computer side as well as the YouTube Remote controller on the mobile device for our second assignment.

## How to join an existing session?

There are two ways to join an existing session: type the session URL directly on another browser or through a QR code.

1. Where is the QR code? A QR code must be visible on the Desktop View only and only when the Desktop View is rendered by the URL with a session number. 
2. What is that QR code? The QR code must be representing the URL with the session number. Using a QR code is a sexy way for mobile devices to join the session. 
3. How to get that QR code? You are suggested to use a public service such as the Google Chart Tools in order to generate a QR code.
